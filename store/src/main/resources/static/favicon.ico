Placeholder favicon file to satisfy browser requests.

This file is intentionally minimal; serving a valid resource under
`/favicon.ico` prevents Spring Boot from logging a `NoResourceFoundException` when
browsers request the default favicon. You may replace this file with an
actual ICO image if desired.
